# Job Dashboard Frontend
This project is a Job Dashboard frontend application built with React. It provides a user interface for viewing job listings, job details, and user authentication. The project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Project Structure
public/: Contains the static files for the application.
src/: Contains the source code of the application.
components/: Reusable React components.
pages/: Page components representing different routes.
App.js: Main application component.
index.js: Entry point of the application.
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

Docker Instructions
You can also run this application using Docker. Follow the steps below to build and run the Docker container.

Dockerfile
Ensure you have a Dockerfile in the root of your project with the following content:

dockerfile
### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000 to the outside world
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
```
docker build -t frontend-image .
```

Running the Docker Container
After building the image, you can run the Docker container with the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name frontend-container frontend-image
```

This will start the container in detached mode and map port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your local machine.

Accessing the Application
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the application, ensure that:

Docker is installed and running on your machine.
No other application is using port 3000.
All dependencies are correctly installed.
For further assistance, refer to the Docker documentation.

Cypress End-to-End Testing
This project uses Cypress for end-to-end testing. Cypress is a JavaScript testing framework that is fast, reliable, and easy to set up and use.

Writing Cypress Tests
Cypress tests are located in the cypress/integration directory. You can create new test files with the .spec.js extension to write your tests.

Here is an example of a basic Cypress test:

```
describe('Job Dashboard', () => {
  it('should display the login page', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/login');
    cy.contains('Login').should('be.visible');
  });

  it('should login and redirect to jobs page', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/login');
    cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('testuser');
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/');
    cy.contains('Jobs').should('be.visible');
  });

  it('should display job details when a job is clicked', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/');
    cy.get('.job-item').first().click();
    cy.contains('Select a job to see details').should('not.exist');
    cy.get('.job-details').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```
# Running Cypress Tests
To run the Cypress tests, follow these steps:

Install Cypress: Make sure you have Cypress installed as a dev dependency. If not, you can install it by running:

```
npm install cypress --save-dev
```
Open Cypress Test Runner: You can open the Cypress Test Runner using the following command:

```
npx cypress open
```
This will launch the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run your tests interactively.

Run Cypress Tests in Headless Mode: If you prefer to run the tests in headless mode (without a GUI), use:
```
npx cypress run
```
